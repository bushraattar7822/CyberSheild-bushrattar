Project Title:

CyberShield – Smart Cybersecurity Awareness and Threat Detection System

💡 What It Is (Simple Explanation):

It’s a cybersecurity website that helps people or organizations stay safe from online threats like phishing, weak passwords, and unsafe websites.
It can also detect and show possible cyber risks and teach users how to protect themselves.

💻 What Your Website Will Have:
🏠 1. Home Page

Title: “CyberShield – Protect Yourself from Cyber Threats”

Shows common cyber threats (Phishing, Malware, Data Theft, Password Leaks).

Buttons like:
🔹 “Check My Security”
🔹 “Learn Cyber Safety”

🔐 2. Password Strength Checker

User types their password.

The system checks and shows:

Weak / Medium / Strong

Suggestions (e.g., “Add numbers or symbols”)

This teaches users to create strong passwords.

🕵️ 3. Phishing URL Detector

User pastes a link (URL).

The website checks if it looks like a phishing site (e.g., fake login pages).

Displays result:

✅ Safe website

⚠️ Suspicious — might be fake

📧 4. Email Threat Analyzer (optional advanced feature)

User pastes a suspicious email or message.

System scans for:

Links that look fake

Urgent or scam words (“Verify now”, “Account locked”)

Gives a risk score (High / Medium / Low).

📘 5. Cyber Awareness Learning Section

Short lessons or tips like:

How to identify phishing

How to secure social media

How to create safe passwords

How to use 2-step verification

Interactive quizzes or infographics.

📊 6. Security Report Page

Shows summary of all checks done:

“Your password is strong.”

“The link you checked was suspicious.”

“You completed Cyber Safety Quiz.”
